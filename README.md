# Portfolio Website by Dario Killenberger

## Technologies/third party components used for each page:

### Home Page
- My own bare hands
- Some .svg animation tutorials
- CSS animations...

### Word Guesser
- Blood, Sweat and Tears

### My Projects
- CSS animations

### Maze
- UseMousePosition hook by Josh W Comeau (https://www.joshwcomeau.com/snippets/react-hooks/use-mouse-position/) (for the cursor sprite)
- Some CSS and React Wizardry (This page still needs lots of work 0.0)

### Resume
- Framer Motion (for the fade out/in when leaving/entering viewport)


## About this site and why I made it
This is not a traditional portfolio website... and it's not meant to be. This is meant to be a bit of React/Javascript practice, as well as familiarizing myself with Typescript. I use a lot of random stuff, and not consistently across all pages (I know I could use framer motion in place of the CSS animations on earlier pages), as I want to experiment with different approaches.
