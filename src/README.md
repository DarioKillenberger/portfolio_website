## About this site and why I made it
This is not a traditional portfolio website... and it's not meant to be. This is meant to be a bit of React/Javascript practice, as well as familiarizing myself with Typescript. I use a lot of random stuff, and not consistently across all pages (I know I could use framer motion in place of the CSS animations on earlier pages), as I want to experiment with different approaches.
